# Qualities

#### Acrobatic or Perceptive Defender <a id="docs-internal-guid-35235e43-7fff-9b9d-99c8-7c498c33a3de"></a>

\(RF 127\)

Applies its skill ranks only. Not specializations or dice.

#### Addiction

\(SR5 77-78\)

* Imposes a penalty of -1 dice, per level of the quality, to all actions if the affected character has not indulged their addiction at least once per run. This penalty carries over from one to the next and stays persistent till the character indulges.
* The Addiction quality can be bought off or brought down to a lower level anytime, by paying the requisite amount of karma.
* Addiction for things that are not statted drugs in the book are handled with the Dependents quality instead. Eg: smoking or alcohol dependency.

#### Adept Healer

\(FA 31\)

Cannot heal drain or fade.

#### Adept Ways

\(SG 176-178\)

* You may only benefit from a single adept way at a time. If you purchase multiple ways you may choose which adept way to follow at the beginning of each month. Changing a way undoes all adept power discounts and turns off any metamagic that is linked to the way. However, you do not lose those metamagics and they can reactivate if you switch back to their linked way.
* The Magician’s Way allows adepts to qualify for any Magician metamagic such as centering, provided they meet all other requirements. Eg: Channeling has no use for an adept as they don’t have the Summoning skill. Mystic adepts need this way to access magician metamagics.

#### Allergy

\(SR5 78\)

You don’t gain karma from the Allergy negative quality, during character creation.

#### Animal Familiar

\(FA 31\)

The quality need not be repurchased. But it takes a full month to attune another animal into a familiar. The animal needs to be purchased separately.

If you make up a new magical academic skill for your character, chargen staff must approve it.

* This will only identify the following negative qualities: Astral beacon, Code of Honor: Harmony with Nature: The Shaman’s Code, Spirit Bane, Spirit Pariah, Reduced \(Astral Sight\).

If alternate manufacturers are listed, as in the case with drones in Rigger 5, those are valid.

#### Chain Breaker

\(FA 33\)

If the character reaches an Astral Reputation of 3 or higher, their ally spirit will go away and will not return them until the character has adequately atoned via the Atonement ritual \(SG 123\). If the quality is bought off, the character must re-conjure an ally spirit using standard rules. All the karma spent on the previous ally spirit goes into an “Astral Bank”. You can use karma from the bank to pay for the new ally spirit.

#### Chosen Follower

\(FA 35\)

* Can be used once per 3 months.
* Learning spells, rituals or improving skills cost karma as usual, but doesn’t require fs.
* Cannot reduce training times.

* If your sensei is a teacher of the Close Combat skill group or any other melee combat skill, they can also teach you martial arts.

#### Shiva Arms

\(RF 118\)

* Characters with Shiva Arms don’t need to spend a Free Action to make Multiple Attacks \(SR5 164\) but they still need to split their dice pool.

* The above bonuses only apply if the character has at least 2 base arms not granted by this quality.

#### Shock Mage

\(FA 40\)

Instead of RAW, any damage inflicted by the mage using lightning spells doubles the initiative reduction \(-10 instead of -5\) as well as the dice pool penalty \(-2 instead of -1\).

#### Special Modifications and Prototype Materials

\(BTB 161-160\)

* Prototype materials cannot be bought at gen.
* You may spend a rank of special modification to alter the element type of a weapon already possessing elemental damage \(like shock gloves\). You may switch between the unlocked elements \(1 per rank\) with a complex action. Available elements are acid, fire, electricity and cold. All elements deal P damage except electricity which can be chosen to deal P or S \(once chosen you cannot change this even when you switch back and forth between unlocked elemental options\).
* Elemental damage from special modifications counts as mundane damage. Acid being non-magical will reapply every turn, instead of evaporating as described in SR5 p.170.
* You may change the selected properties or the amount of the properties \(DV, -AP or elemental damage\) from the qualities between each run.
* -AP from special mods are not considered as base AP of the weapon and thus do not get tripled for bullseye burst, instead getting added after tripling base AP.
* You may purchase up to two ranks of Special Modifications for additional weapons beyond your first. There is no limit to the additional number of weapons that can have this.
* If a weapon is a combination of different weapons or modes \(eg: Krime Trollbow,  Krime Whammy or Microwave Gun\), the player must choose which of the weapons the qualities’ bonuses would apply to.
* Special Modifications cannot be used to reduce the reach of a weapon beyond its base value.

#### Sprawl Tamer

Increases the number of tricks that a critter can learn by a multiplier of 1 and stacks with everything else that increases the number of tricks. Hence, the number of tricks a critter is capable of learning becomes 3x their Logic. Domesticated critters can now learn a number of tricks equal to 4x their Logic.

#### Stalwart Ally

\(FA 42\)

* The ally spirit can give its Magic as a dice pool bonus to only a single drain resistance test per run.
* The point of Edge you may get loaned from your ally spirit cannot be burned and it does not give you +1 die when pre-edging, as it's not your own Edge attribute.

#### Strive for Perfection

\(AP 17\)

* Applies before Sharpshooter.
* Doesn’t impede you from making an attack if making a called shot is impossible. Eg: medium or wide choke settings, interrupt action attacks, etc. However, not being able to call a shot due to having used up your free action elsewhere is not a valid reason.

#### SURGE

\(RF 103\)

* There is no karma cap on how many metagenic negative qualities you can take. You still have to take at least the total karma equivalent of your total metagenic positive qualities. You do not gain anything from taking extra metagenic negative qualities apart from the qualities themselves.
* SURGE I \(10 karma\) and SURGE II \(15 karma\) will follow the same rules as SURGE III \(30 karma\). The maximum total karma value of positive metagenic qualities that you can get from these qualities is equal to the karma values listed in brackets.
