# Recommended Gear

The following gear is recommended to have on your character before you submit for review. While none of these are mandatory, having some of them will significantly improve your character’s life experience in the 6th world while not having some of them may significantly hamper their life.

### Fake SIN

A fake SIN is possibly the most important piece of gear every character should have. Even if you have a real SIN you do not want to use that for crimes, for it has all your relevant biometric and personal information allowing cops to easily track you down. Instead a fake SIN has high quality fake info, allowing you to exist in society without much of an issue and do crimes without fear of the authorities using your SIN to track you down.

1. Due to how SIN scanners work, you’d want a Rating 4 SIN \(or Rating 5 if you are playing a prime gen PC and can afford it\). This will minimize the chances of a SIN scanner noticing your SIN is fake. A fake SIN that gets caught gets burned immediately which is a lot of lost nuyen. So buy a good SIN
2. A SIN should have a bunch of attached licenses. Make sure the rating of each of your licenses match the rating of your SIN.
3. Any gear that has an R next to their availability must have a license or be deemed illegal. A single license will cover any number of items that are covered by that license. These licenses are based on UCAS law and may differ in different nations. As for what licenses you may need include:

* An awakened license depending on what type of awakened you are. Adepts need an “Adept License”, Magicians of any type need a “Mage License”, Mystic adepts need both a mage and an adept license.
* A technomancer license for registered Resonance use.
* A “Foci License” for any restricted focus you may have on your person.
* A “Firearm License”, that will cover all your restricted firearms.
* A “Weapon License”, that will cover all of your non firearm weapons, such as bows, melee weapons, etc.
* A “Concealed Carry Permit” for weapons you may want to keep concealed on you.
* A “Restricted Armor” license for any restricted armor you may have. Keep in mind even with a license, not all armor is appropriate for all locations and can make security very suspicious or even alarmed.
* A “Driver’s License” if you wish to not use the grid guide system and manually drive your vehicle. Keep in mind, some locations may not have grid guide, forcing you to manually drive.
* A “Vehicle License” if your vehicle is restricted or you add a restricted mod to it.
* An “Augmentations” license that covers all your restricted ware.
* A “Pet License” if you have a restricted animal as a pet.
* A “Cyberdeck License” if you own one.
* A “Drone License” if you own restricted drones and/or an RCC.
* A “Software License” for any restricted software or autosofts you may have.
* An “Explosives License” for any restricted explosives \(including grenades\) that you may possess.
* A “Drug License” for any restricted drugs you may have.
* A professional license of any kind to help justify why you have so many restricted gear on you. Likely candidates are Bodyguard, Bounty hunter, Private investigator, Matrix security specialist, 

### Transportation

Taking public transportation is slow, tedious and can be risky. Try to have your own transportation before you leave. A Nissan Jackrabbit is a cheap option for a car. If you wish to spend a bit more, then the Dodge Xenon is a great option and very stylish. If you prefer 2-wheelers, a Dodge Scoot is about as cheap as it gets but the Yamaha Growler is close. If you have more money a Suzuki Mirage is a speedy and stylish option for its price. Try to have a car if you are a decker or a technomancer, as you do not want to pass out in the open while you do your hacking.  
If you are a rigger and are looking for a big mother vehicle to haul around your drones and the whole team, the GMC Bulldog is a solid, armored option; great for offense and defense. You can also get a GMC Universe which is a literal bus and has the carrying capacity of a bus. Owning a bus won’t raise too much suspicion, even today a lot of rich people own luxury bus RVs. In general, as a rigger you’d want a vehicle with a high Body attribute and a decent number of seats.

Finally, you should have the following vehicle modifications added to your vehicle:

1. Morphing License Plate: So the authorities cannot take a photo of your license plate and use it to track your vehicle down.
2. Spoof Chips: So your car does not get tracked via real time matrix.
3. Smuggling Compartment: So you can haul around all your F-rated gear. There is no license for forbidden gear, to get caught with one is a felony.
4. Smuggling Compartment Shielding: This prevents certain scanners from scanning your secret stash. MAD is the most important one if you have illegal weapons stashed. Olfactory is also a good one to avoid your explosives or huge drug stash from getting sniffed out.
5. Anti-theft System: A rating 2 is usually enough, A rating 3 will punish any unsuccessful thieves with a blast of electricity or pepper punch. However, rating 3 mod is restricted. Never buy the rating 4 system. Not only is it illegal, it's a literal bomb and will blow up your vehicle.
6. Gridlink Override: Gridlink will cooperate with cops and with traffic laws. Many times, you don’t want that. Turn off gridlink and get away before the cops catch you, frag that red signal. It's an illegal mod, but don’t worry, it's too small to be noticed.

### Armor and Clothing

Your lifestyle covers non-armored clothing. But this is the 6th world, it’s dangerous and everyone wears some armor. There are two sets of armor you should have: A high society armor and street armor. Street armor is what you wear in most areas of the city. The Armor Jacket is a great option. It’s cheap and has good capacity. The Urban Explorer Daedalus is another good option as you can add a chemical seal to it, most other armor that accept that mod are heavy combat armors.  
For your high fashion, high society armor, there are quite a few choices:

1. Mortimer of London: Berwick suit/dress and/or Argentum coat. It offers a lot of social bonuses and a popular choice for faces and Johnsons. You can wear one or either or both.
2. Zoe: Executive suit, often combined with Second Skin. The suit itself is cheap and decently protective, the second skin offers more protection but is expensive.
3. Vashion Island: Sleeping tiger, often combined with Synergist long coat. This armor is almost as protective as high end combat armor while being fashionable in a bohemian sense. It’s very expensive but the gold standard for shadow runners and criminal syndicates alike.

If you lack the cash you should choose either a street or a high society armor. Eventually you might want a suit of Full Body Armor for those situations where you will be going into a hot zone, guns blazing. But you need not worry about that during character creation. As for armor accessories keep in mind you don’t benefit from their armor beyond your Str and star getting penalties beyond Str+1. Helmets, Ballistic masks, Forearm guards and PPPs are popular choices.  
Most armor have capacity and you’d want to fill them with armor mods:

1. Elemental attacks are common, the most common among them is electricity. Nonconductivity 6 is a good choice followed by Fire resistance and Insulation for cloaks.
2. If your armor cannot install a Chemical Seal, you definitely want Chemical Protection 6 for some extra soak against contact toxins.
3. Installing a Gas mask and/or Respirator into your ballistic mask or your helmet will save you from inhalation toxins.
4. An autoinjector in your forearm guard or helmet is great for quick drug injections provided you have pre loaded it with a dose. Saves your action economy. Make sure to pair it with a biomonitor.

### Firearms

Even if you are a dedicated melee combatant, it's generally advisable to have a ranged combat skill handy, the most common of which are firearms. Large guns have more power but are hard to conceal while small guns are easy to conceal and despite lacking in damage they can pull off tricks like toxin injections that can be quite effective. I’ll list some good guns in popular categories, although not all may be purchasable at character creation.

1. Light Pistols: Ares Lightfire, Narcoject One
2. Heavy Pistols: Savalette Guardian, Ruger Super Warhawk, HK Urban Fighter, Lemat 2072, Hammerli Gemini
3. Machine Pistols: Remington Suppressor, Steyr TMP
4. SMGs: Ingram Smartgun X, SCK Model 100, Ares Sigma 3, HK Urban Combat
5. Shotguns: Krime Boss, Mossberg AM-CMDT, Auto-assault 16
6. Assault Rifles: AK-97, Ares Alpha, Yamaha Raiden
7. Sporting Rifles: Springfield 2003
8. Sniper Rifles: Ares Desert Strike, Cavalier Arms Crockett EBR, Remington 950, Terracotta Arms AM-47, Barret Model 122
9. Light Machine Guns: Krime Wave
10. Heavy Machine Guns: Ruhrmetall SF-20, Stoner-Ares M-22A1

### Miscellaneous Gear

Shadowrun is gear porn. There are plenty of useful gear you’d want before leaving character creation. I’ll list a few.

1. Commlink: It's very important to have a commlink. It's your phone! Good choices at gen are Renraku Sensei, Erika Elite and Nixdorf Sekretar. Your RCC or cyberdeck can also function as a commlink. Metalinks are great disposable phones for that one off untraceable phone call.
2. Trodes or Trode patch: You’d want this if you don’t have a datajack or a control rig. It allows you to access DNI which is basically telepathic electronic communication via matrix.
3. Micro-transceiver: Sometimes using the matrix is risky or the matrix is not available. In those cases instead of DNI radio waves are your friend.
4. Contacts and Glasses: Fill them up with vision enhancement 3, vision magnification, flare compensation, image link, low light vision and thermographic vision \(if you lack them naturally\).
5. Headphones or Earbuds: Fill them up with audio enhancement 3 and sound link
6. Medkit and Medkit supplies: When you expect to get shot you’d want a first aid kit. Higher ratings will have better bonuses but are bigger up to a duffle bag size.
7. Biomonitor: Allows to easily diagnose yourself as well as allows automated medkits and autoinjectors to do their pre-programmed thing.
8. Climbing gear and Gecko tape gloves: If you are the climbing or B&E type, you’d want these.
9. Grapple gun, Rappelling gloves and Rope: Alternate B&E climbing gear.
10. Autopicker: Necessary to unlock mechanical locks.
11. Sequencer: Helps you break keypad mag locks if you are not a locksmith.
12. Maglock Passkey: Helps you break keycard mag locks if you are not a locksmith
13. Lockpick Set: If you are a locksmith, you are better off with these simple tools.
14. Miniwelder: What you cannot pick, simply cut through with your torch.
15. Bug scanner and Tag eraser: Needed to scan for tags and erase them. People can stealth tag you and track your physical location via the tags.
16. Jammer: An area jammer is great for knocking off wireless support from enemy gear around you while keeping your and your allies’ wireless on.
17. Endoscope: Scout out under doors and around corners without exposing yourself.
18. Crowbar: If you are not swole, use a force multiplier to crack open jammed doors and containers.
19. Stimpatch and Trauma patches: The former to temporarily alleviate too much stun damage or getting knocked out from stun damage. The latter to stabilize you in case of a full physical track before first aid can be applied.
20. Ondansteron: A drug that's helpful for resisting nausea, in case you don’t have a Gastric Neurostimulator implant.
21. Neostigmine: A drug that's helpful for resisting paralysis.
22. Guts: A drug that is very useful for completely countering fear effects.
