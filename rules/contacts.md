# Contacts

### Contact Dice Pool <a id="docs-internal-guid-e93f04a9-7fff-1266-c855-0a8e3f728db7"></a>

Contacts roll Connection x 2 + Loyalty + Domain bonus, as dice pool. Domain bonus is a flat +6 dice pool modifier that applies to the contact’s area of specialization. Contacts have no limit for their dice pool, except if the limit involves Force or Level. Contacts will usually not edge their rolls for you.

### Contact Types

There are three types of contacts.

#### Fixers

Fixers help you land jobs and introduce you to new people. Fixers apply their domain bonus to networking which is a service exclusive to fixers. If you are in need of a temporary contact or to get in touch with someone, your fixer can roll their dice pool with a threshold equal to the connection of the person you are trying to get in touch with. If they succeed on the networking test, you may use that temporary contact for the duration of the run. All temporary contacts have a loyalty of 1 that cannot be improved unless you have them permanently as a run reward.

#### Gear Contacts

These contacts will sell you gear and/or fence gear for you. All gear contacts can sell or fence any gear type. However, each gear contact has a domain based on their gear specialty. The contact will get the domain bonus for only gear of that type. Gear domains are:

* Augmentations \(Cyberware, Bioware, Genemods and Nanoware\)
* Armor and Clothing \(includes armor mods and accessories\)
* Chemist \(sells toxins and all drugs, including custom drugs\)
* Critters \(mundane and paracritters as well as their training equipment\)
* Weapons and Ammunition \(includes weapon mods and grenades\)
* Electronics \(cyberdecks, RCCs, commlinks, software and other electronic gear\)
* Explosives
* Vehicles and Drones \(includes vehicle and drone mods\)
* SINs and Licenses
* Talismonger \(sells all manner of magical goods\)
* Miscellaneous \(any gear not covered by the other domains\)

#### Service Contacts

These contacts offer a specific service and apply their domain bonus to all rolls involving that service \(Eg: a street doctor applies their domain bonus to all healing and medicine rolls\). This could be an NPC hacker, a getaway driver, a doctor, a lawyer, an information broker, an alchemist, a makeup artist, etc. Feel free to be creative when coming up with a service contact. Service contacts can be asked to do a service outside of their domain, at GM discretion. Doing so will either result in them refusing or increasing the Favor rating needed by 1. They will also not gain their domain bonus for that task.  


Service contacts may teamwork you as part of their service. Add the contact’s Connection + Loyalty as teamwork dice \(limited by your skill rating\) for the test. The Favor Rating per teamwork is equal to the contact’s Connection - Loyalty \(minimum 1\). The contact does not suffer drain or fade. The standard rules and house rules for teamwork apply.  


* Free Spirit: Free Spirits are a type of service contact. Powerful entities with alien and capricious natures, however they often find humans fascinating or at least useful to have around. Free Spirits will often trade their powers for favor \(if it has the Spirit Mark contact power\). In general a free spirit functions as a full magician service contact and is able to assist on spellcasting, ritual casting, and other magical tasks. The Force of a free spirit is equal to their Connection. Free spirit contacts know a number of powers equal to their Connection, including a single Greater power \(SG 205\). They may not know great form spirit powers.

### Gaining Contacts

Apart from gaining them via the Carousing downtime action, contacts can be gained by paying Nuyen, Karma or a mix of both. You can obtain a new contact by paying:

* \(Connection + 1\) Karma, or
* \(Connection + 1\) x 4000¥, or
* A mix of both using the exchange rate of 1 Karma = 4000¥

Gaining contacts this way doesn't cost downtime slots. The maximum Connection of a contact that can be gained this way is 4. Loyalty starts at 1. You then upgrade the contact’s Connection and Loyalty via the Carousing downtime action listed in our [Downtime Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QlGxzpuF8w66V4Cmghf-E8ManG9gXLlFdt1lvd5LX18/edit#).

### Buying Gear

Buying gear is handled differently from RAW.

* Buying gear is an extended test \(cumulative penalty of -1 per roll beyond the first\). The availability acts as the threshold \(you do not roll against the availability\).
* Either your character or one of the character’s contacts can roll to buy gear once per day in real time \(you may edge your negotiation test as normal\). Keep track of your/their hits. Once you/they meet the threshold you instantly get the item.
* Alternatively, instead of rolling once per day you may roll the entire extended test on the same day \(with a cumulative -1 per roll beyond the first\), keeping note of how many checks it took to get the item. If you succeed, you get the item after a number of days equal to the number of checks it took. Succeed or fail, the contact is now unavailable for a number of days equal to the number of checks you made. Eg: If you made 3 checks today to successfully acquire an item, you get the item 2 days from now. Succeed or fail, the contact is not available until the 3 days from today.
* You may not combine the hits of different contacts or you and your contacts.
* A character or a contact can only work on the availability rolls of one gear at a time \(although you can buy multiple copies of that gear once you succeed\). Should they try to roll availability for another gear before succeeding in their previous availability roll, all progress is lost. You and a contact or multiple contacts cannot teamwork towards a gear.
* Once the extended tests succeed, delivery time is instant. If the test fails, you can try again from the start. You don’t need to pay the price of the gear.

### Selling Gear

When selling/fencing gear using a gear contact. You get an amount of money back, equal to \(Loyalty x 10\)% of the original price of the gear. To gain these selling prices, gear must be sold to a gear contact with a domain that matches the gear being sold.

### Gaining and Improving Contacts

Rules for gaining new contacts or improving a contact’s loyalty or connection is described in the [Downtime Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QlGxzpuF8w66V4Cmghf-E8ManG9gXLlFdt1lvd5LX18/edit?usp=sharing).

### Tests of Loyalty

Situations may arise where your contact is on the fence about not helping you or you risk the contact’s loyalty going down due to the actions of the player. In such a case, the GM should roll a dice pool of \(13 - Connection\) of the contact with threshold equal to \(6 - Loyalty of the contact\). If the test succeeds the contact will help you and/or there is no loss of loyalty.  


If loyalty of a contact does go down due to the bad actions of the player, it should not go down more than 1 point at a time. A contact that drops to 0 loyalty is forever lost.

### Favors

Favors are an abstract metric of measuring the value of a service provided by a contact. The most direct way to repay a favor is to pay nuyen on the spot. Alternatively, you may hold on to that favor and repay them in downtime, without paying nuyen. GMs are free to determine the rating of a favor or consult with the rest of the table as to what the favor rating should be based on the magnitude of the service provided. Keep in mind, rating 5 and 6 favors are for truly big or outrageous requests. If you already owe a contact a favor, you cannot ask for more favors from that contact until you repay the last one.  


The nuyen cost of favors depends on the loyalty of a contact. Consult the following table.  


| Favor Rating | Loyalty 1 | Loyalty 2 | Loyalty 3 | Loyalty 4 | Loyalty 5 | Loyalty 6 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Rating 1 | 1000¥ | 900¥ | 800¥ | 700¥ | 600¥ | 500¥ |
| Rating 2 | 2000¥ | 1800¥ | 1600¥ | 1400¥ | 1200¥ | 1000¥ |
| Rating 3 | 4000¥ | 3600¥ | 3200¥ | 2800¥ | 2400¥ | 2000¥ |
| Rating 4 | 8000¥ | 7200¥ | 6400¥ | 5600¥ | 4800¥ | 4000¥ |
| Rating 5 | 16,000¥ | 14,400¥ | 12,800¥ | 11,200¥ | 9600¥ | 8000¥ |
| Rating 6 | 32,000¥ | 28,800¥ | 25,600¥ | 22,400¥ | 19,200¥ | 16,000¥ |

Contact powers that require a favor will list the rating of the favor needed. Here are some listed favor ratings for common services.

* Alchemy: Alchemical preps can only be purchased during a run. What spells are available as preps and their price depend solely on the GM. A suggested guideline for prep prices is Favor Rating = Force/2. Trigger must be Contact or Timed. All preps purchased during a run will be rendered inert after the run, even if placed inside a vault of ages.
* First Aid: Rating 1 Favor per roll, when done in their clinic. Rating 2 for house calls. Contacts are not affected by the healing modifiers table. First aid by contacts don't have a threshold of 2, they heal one box of damage per hit.
* Magical Healing: Rating 1 Favor per roll, when done in their lodge. Rating 2 for house calls. Contacts are not affected by the healing modifiers table. The spell is cast at Connection Force. The contact takes no drain.
* Preparing Inanimate Vessel: Using a contact to prepare an inanimate vessel will work in this manner.

1. You must have an appropriate service contact \(eg: an alchemist contact\). 
2. You must provide the number of radical reagents \(5 x Force of spirit\) yourself, using your own money. 
3. Alternatively, you may use a R6 favor and ask the alchemist contact to refine standard reagents into radical ones, at a rate of 100:1. You must still pay for the standard reagents. The contact follows the rules in \(SG 210\) to make these, you may buy hits to gain 3 hits and avoid unnecessary dice rolling.
4. The contact then rolls for ritual. If the contact succeeds, you owe them a R3 favor. If the contact fails, you owe them nothing, but some radical reagents are lost as per \(SG 214\).
5. If a drone or vehicle has been successfully prepared as a vessel, it continues to remain a vessel even if it was destroyed and then reformed via the "Nanomachines, Son!" power.

### Force or Level

The maximum force or level a contact can use for things that have a force or level is limited to their Connection. Contacts also add the rating of their lodge, as limit, to any tests involving force. The rating of their lodge is equal to their Connection. Contacts do not suffer drain or fade.

### Contact Powers

Each contact has access to a single power. You are free to choose any power from the following list, provided your contact meets the requirements. We are always looking for new contact power ideas. Feel free to contact us to bounce off new ideas.

The cost of the object should be a maximum of 50 times the cost of the Favor, calculated at loyalty 1. The final cost of borrowing the item is then modified by loyalty, as per the favor table. Should the player lose the object or the object gets destroyed during the run \(damage that can be repaired is not penalized\), the contact will lose a number of Loyalty equal to the rating of the Favor. If loyalty drops to 0, the player character permanently loses the contact and gains a point of notoriety.

Each safehouse comes replete with a lodge equal to the connection of the contact. The lodge will work for any tradition.

### Group Contacts

Group contacts work differently than standard individual contacts. You may use group contacts for knowledge skill rolls and legwork. When using group contacts, make your own dice roll but add the connection of the group contact as a positive dice pool modifier. If the group contact is an initiation or submersion group, you can add its connection to your initiation/submersion roll. You may only apply a single group contact to a roll.

#### Connection

The Connection of a group contact ranges from 1 to 5. Their Loyalty rating is capped at 1 unless stated otherwise. Here’s how group contacts would be ranked based on their connection.

* Connection 1: A school. A dojo. A technomancer tribe. An initiation group. Small street gangs or Policlubs, etc.
* Connection 2: Universities. Large go gangs like Ancients or Cutters. Large policlubs like Humanis or Orc Rights Commission. Most mid sized criminal syndicates. Unrated corps.
* Connection 3: A rated corps. Large or international crime syndicates like the Shotozumi or Watada rengo of the Yakuza. The Black Lodge.
* Connection 4: AA rated corps and small nations.
* Connection 5: AAA corps and large nations like UCAS, CAS, etc.

#### Membership

Players can only have a group contact up to Connection 3. The Made Man quality grants you a free group contact of Connection 1 to 3 \(depending on which gang or syndicate you join\). Group contacts work like positive qualities and count against the positive quality limit during character creation. Group contacts that players can have, can be purchased during character creation by paying \(Connection x 2\) + 1 karma. After character creation, purchasing a group contact costs \(Connection x 4\) + 2 karma. As per RAW they function like qualities and thus count towards the positive quality cap during character creation.  
The GM or Chargen department can veto your purchase if you are buying group contacts for multiple gangs or syndicates \(especially rival ones\).
