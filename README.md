# Start Here

Neon Anarchy is a table top gaming community for Shadowrun 5e. Here you can play Shadowrun online, for free, with players from around the world in an online \(discord-based\) persistent setting and world.

### Get Started

#### Step 1

Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/eaX2jxG) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeonAnarchy/).

#### Step 2

Start by reading our [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/channels/723562333548314634/741294704649306212/745260788020674590).

#### Step 3

If you are interested in playing here then you need a character. Make sure to read all our documentation here. And if you use Chummer \(highly recommended\) remember to add this custom [Chummer Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OGsaS8BzSKhYGpYyW9fB5RxzvSfhoAm5) there for a smoother experience.
